                    <i>Charismatic</i>
                    <br>
                    Hitler was a charismatic leader who used symbols, oratory, and image to appeal to the masses. He was a skilled public speaker who used language to appeal to the subconscious and illogical parts of the population.

                    <u>Strong politician</u>
                    <br>
                    Hitler was a strong politician who used <sub>propaganda</sub> through the party <sup>newspaper</sup>, Völkischer Beobachter, and meetings that drew thousands of people.

                    Hitler had a vision for Germany's future and believed he was the one chosen to return Germany to its former greatness. He exploited the economic, social, and political conditions in Germany after World War I for political gain. 
                    However, others say that Hitler's style of command had several problems. After the war, his former generals portrayed him as a megalomaniac who refused to listen to military experts and lost the war for Germany</p>
